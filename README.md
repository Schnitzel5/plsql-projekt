# CodeLab
### by Philip Duong & Christopher Reisinger 4DHIF

## Progress
DDL script done, Mock data soon

## About this project
Motivated programmers can learn new programming languages using CodeLab, 
an application where users sign into tracks, accept tasks, submit their 
solutions, and get points if the hand-in is valid.

## Structure
Users has a bunch of flags (email notifications, ToS agreement, …) and has a record of points, 
solved challenges, badges. 

Tracks (e.g., Java, C, …) includes a bunch of tags (e.g., Object-oriented, Functional, …), 
count of exercises and concepts, the icon representing the language.

Concepts are basically just a theory page for the upcoming exercises.
Completing all the connected exercises will also mark the current concept as mastered.

Exercises have a status (completed, in-progress and available), a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, ...), 
instructions which will be checked by tests once the solution is submitted (new iteration for each submit).
